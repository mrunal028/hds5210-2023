But, failed to pull out relevant datasets.Yeah, it's responses made sense to me in terms of where it's trying to search the data from and what it's asking me to keep in mind before starting to write code. It refined the project idea well but it did not write the code well. It tried to write a Machine learning model and have input factors and some transformations which make sense but not much related to what the plan is. Overall, it's useful but we need to be the decision maker.*"
