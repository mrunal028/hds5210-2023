# Midterm Feedback
The midterm feedback will be very similar to what you receive on a weekly basis for the homework, but more specific for each problem in this case.

## Final Score: 28/50


### Step 1: Priest Score Calculation
* **5pts** (-1) Your code computed the correct probability and returned it. Your code should test for all invalid inputs, not just for sex.
* **5pts** (-5) The format of your docstring resembles ChatGPT, not Professor Boal's examples. 

### Step 2: Find a Hospital
* **5pts** (-1) Your code correctly fetched the correct hospital given the inputs using requests. Your function should return None if anything fails.
* **2pts** (-2) This docstring is better than your first function; however, the format of your docstring does not exactly follow Professor Boal's examples, and does not contain the expected input/output types.
* **3pts** - You had at least three doctests in your docstring

### Step 3: Get the Hospital Address
* **5pts** (-2) Your code is set up for a saved file. It need to fetch the file, and then parsed it, and looked up the hospital
* **2pts** (-2) This docstring is better than your first function; however, the format of your docstring does not exactly follow Professor Boal's examples, and does not contain the expected input/output types.
* **3pts** - You had at least three doctests in your docstring

### Step 4: Process List of Patients
* **10pts** (-8) Your code is not correct and does not meet the requiremetns. You are not fetching and processing a file, and you are not processing the rows per the instructions. Your function is incorrectly named and does not output what it should.
* **2pts** (-2) This docstring is better than your first function; however, the format of your docstring does not exactly follow Professor Boal's examples, and does not contain the expected input/output types.

### Step 5: Compare Results
* **5pts** (-3) Your code does not meet the requirements. It should call your function from Part 4 and retrieve results (rather than reading in a saved file).

### Extra Credit
* Up to 15 pts based on correctness and quality of the extra credit step
  * **(+4)** I gave you a few points for effort; howeve, your function does not meet the requirements. You did not include a docstring. You are not processing the results from your previous functions. The sample results you've included here are not formatted like the results should be. 

### Coding Best Practices:
**3 pts** - Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?
* Good variable names?
  * **Nice job.** 
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
  * **Your functions are nicely formatted.** 
* Appropriate comments with your code?
  * **Two of your functions contained good code comments.** 
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
  * **Your code is easy to follow and understand.**
