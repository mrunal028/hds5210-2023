**(-2) Your code to reach from MySQL could not have run as written.  This appears to be a copy of sample code, but is missing critical things like the variable `table_name`.**

**(-1) Your data were only concatenated together. No merge/join was performed.**

**I found it interesting that the Max BMI was 104.97 and had to look that up to believe it was possible!**

**(-5) You did some great analyses, but didn't help us understand the results.  For example, your correlation analysis produced coefficients and p-values, but you didn't take time to describe what that meant to the reader.  You explained why you were doing the analysis, but not what the results meant.**
